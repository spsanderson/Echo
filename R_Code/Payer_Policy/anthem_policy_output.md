**LLM Response:** "The file path you provided — `C:/Users/steve/Documents/GitHub/Echo/R_Code/Payer_Policy/Anthem_PDFs/CAID_RstrAutomationTmplt.xls` — appears to point to a local Excel template file, likely used for automating restrictions or coding rules for Anthem Medicaid (CAID = California Medicaid) policies. However, **this is not a publicly accessible or standard payer policy document** — it is a local file that may contain internal automation templates, not official coverage policy language.

Since I cannot access local file systems or proprietary internal templates, I cannot summarize the content of this specific `.xls` file.

---

✅ **Recommendation:**
If you need a summary of an **official Anthem Medicaid (California) policy**, please provide:
- The **official policy name** (e.g., “Anthem California Medicaid Policy on Genetic Testing”)
- A **publicly available URL** or **PDF text** of the policy
- Or upload the actual policy document (if permitted)

I can then summarize it according to standard payer policy format (Policy Summary → Key Points → Policy Information Table).

Let me know how else I can assist!"

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary:**

This Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield (New York Medicaid) policy outlines the requirements for requesting prior authorization for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) testing. The policy emphasizes that formal psychological testing is not routinely indicated for behavioral health screening or brief inventories, which are considered part of standard diagnostic interviews. Testing must be clinically justified, with prior completion of diagnostic interviews and screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, SCQ, CARS). Requests for educational, forensic, or disability evaluations are explicitly excluded as not medically necessary. Providers must use the designated form for ASD testing only and refer educational assessments to public school systems. The form requires detailed clinical documentation, including treatment history, rationale for testing, and specific CPT codes for services requested (e.g., 96130–96139). Testing must directly inform treatment planning, and if the intent is to access Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) services, this must be explicitly indicated.

**Key Points:**

- **Clinical Justification Required**: Testing must follow a diagnostic interview and administration of validated screeners (e.g., M-CHAT, SCQ); screening tools alone are not sufficient for authorization.
- **Exclusions**: Educational, forensic, or disability evaluations are not covered under this policy; providers must refer such requests to the public school system.
- **Authorization Process**: Must be submitted via Availity Essentials; requires detailed clinical documentation, treatment history, rationale for testing, and specific CPT codes (96130–96139) with time units.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This document is the *Overpayment Refund Notification Form* used by Anthem for New York Medicaid and Medicare Advantage providers. Its purpose is to facilitate the timely processing of overpayment refunds by requiring providers to submit completed forms along with returned checks and supporting documentation. If the refund check is issued by Anthem, the provider must specify the reason for returning it. The form collects essential provider and member information, service details, and the reason for the refund. Once submitted, Anthem’s Cost Containment unit reviews the overpayment and sends a reconciliation letter to the provider. The form also includes a legal notice regarding the proper handling of Protected Health Information (PHI).

**Key Points**  
- Providers must submit a completed form with all refund checks and documentation to process overpayments.  
- If returning an Anthem-issued check, the reason for return must be clearly indicated (e.g., duplicate payment, wrong member, contract rate change, etc.).  
- Refunds should be mailed to Anthem’s P.O. Box in Atlanta, GA; providers will receive a reconciliation letter after review.  
- PHI must not be disclosed or used for individuals not under the provider’s care or enrolled in their practice.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This document is a provider brochure from Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York) introducing the **Interactive Care Reviewer (ICR)** tool for prior authorization (PA) requests. The ICR is an electronic platform accessible via Availity Essentials for providers with an NPI, enabling submission of outpatient and inpatient PA requests for both physical and behavioral health services. The tool leverages clinical analytics to deliver immediate decisions — sometimes within 15 minutes — for higher levels of care such as inpatient, intensive outpatient, and partial hospitalization. The brochure emphasizes reduced administrative burden, faster access to care, error reduction, and improved provider efficiency by eliminating fax-based submissions.

**Key Points**  
- **Eligibility**: Only providers with an NPI can access ICR; it is not available to providers without one.  
- **Functionality**: ICR supports PA submissions, benefit checks, status tracking, and secure clinical documentation upload — all online, 24/7.  
- **Benefits**: Eliminates faxing, reduces errors, provides instant reference numbers, offers templates for recurring requests, and saves an average of 15 minutes per case (4–5 hours/week).

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This document is a **Request for Authorization form for Neuropsychological Testing** under **Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid)**. It outlines the clinical and administrative requirements for submitting a request for neuropsychological testing, which is defined as a comprehensive evaluation of cognitive, motor, and behavioral functions related to brain disorders. Testing is considered **medically necessary** only when results will have a **timely and direct impact on the member’s treatment plan**. Repeat testing is generally not warranted unless justified on a case-by-case basis. The form requires detailed clinical documentation, including prior evaluations, diagnoses, medications, substance use history, and specific clinical questions the testing aims to answer.

**Key Points**  
- ✅ **Medically Necessary Criteria**: Testing must directly influence the member’s treatment plan; repeat testing requires individual justification.  
- 📋 **Required Documentation**: Must include clinical assessments (e.g., neurologic exam, neuroimaging, psychiatric evaluation), ICD-10 diagnoses, medication list, and substance use history.  
- ⚠️ **Exclusions/Notes**: Authorization is not a guarantee of payment; incomplete or illegible forms will not be processed. Network providers do not need prior authorization for routine outpatient care, but neuropsychological testing does require verification of eligibility.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary:**

This document is a **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Request Form** for **New York Medicaid** members, administered by **Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield**. It is used to request prior authorization for TMS treatment of **severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)** in adults who have not responded adequately to standard treatments. The form requires detailed clinical documentation, including prior medication trials, psychotherapy history, use of standardized depression rating scales, and confirmation that the TMS device is FDA-approved and administered per manufacturer guidelines. It also screens for contraindications such as seizure history, implanted metal devices, or psychotic disorders.

The policy emphasizes that TMS is considered **medically necessary** only when specific criteria are met — including failure of at least four psychopharmacologic trials (with at least two different classes and two augmentation therapies), or intolerance to medications, and documented symptom severity using validated scales. Maintenance TMS may be considered if prior response was documented with >50% symptom improvement.

---

**Key Points:**

- ✅ **Coverage Indication**: TMS is covered for **adults with severe MDD** who have failed ≥4 antidepressant trials (including ≥2 classes and ≥2 augmentation therapies) or are intolerant to medications.
- ⚠️ **Contraindications**: Excludes individuals with seizure disorders (except ECT/febrile), active psychosis, CNS tumors, epilepsy, or implanted magnetic-sensitive devices within 30 cm of the coil (e.g., pacemakers, cochlear implants).
- 📊 **Documentation Required**: Must include use of standardized depression rating scales (e.g., PHQ-9, HAMD, MADRS), proof of prior psychotherapy trial, and FDA-approved device usage per manufacturer protocol (typically 30 sessions over 6 weeks + taper).

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This document is Anthem’s *Behavioral Health Quick Reference Guide* for New York Medicaid programs, including Health and Recovery Plan (HARP), Child Health Plus (CHPlus), Essential Plan, Foster Care, and Medicaid Managed Care (MMC)/SSI. It outlines coverage status and authorization requirements for behavioral health services rendered by in-network (INN) and out-of-network (OON) providers. Most services are covered for INN providers without prior authorization, while OON services universally require authorization. Inpatient psychiatric services require notification within two business days, with concurrent review triggered if notification is delayed or high-risk criteria are unmet. Certain services (e.g., TMS, CORE, Behavioral Health HCBS) are not covered across all plans. Crisis and residential services have specific notification or authorization rules depending on the plan.

**Key Points**

- **In-Network Providers**: Most outpatient behavioral health services (e.g., OPMH, CFTSS, ABA, psych testing) are covered without prior authorization.
- **Out-of-Network Providers**: All services require prior authorization.
- **Inpatient Psychiatric Services**: Notification within 2 business days is mandatory; failure to notify triggers concurrent review. High-risk criteria may defer review until day 31.
- **Excluded Services**: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), CORE services, and Behavioral Health HCBS are not covered under any plan.
- **Crisis & Residential Services**: Crisis residential, intensive crisis, and residential crisis support services require notification; some youth SUD residential services are not covered.

**LLM Response:** "Based on the available document metadata and partial text retrieved, here is a summary of the **Anthem New York Essential Plan Provider Manual** (as of July 2024):

---

### **Policy Summary**

This document serves as the **Provider Manual** for Anthem’s **Essential Plan (EP)** in New York, designed to guide healthcare providers on billing, coverage, and administrative procedures for services rendered to EP members. The Essential Plan is a state-sponsored health coverage program for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers who do not qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance. It is administered through the NY State of Health Marketplace.

The manual outlines provider responsibilities, claim submission guidelines, prior authorization requirements, and coverage policies aligned with New York State regulations. It also references Anthem’s provider services contact information and directs providers to the official state health portal for member enrollment and eligibility verification.

---

### **Key Points**

- **Coverage Scope**: The Essential Plan covers essential health benefits including preventive care, primary care, hospitalization, maternity, mental health, and prescription drugs — consistent with ACA-compliant plans.
- **Provider Network**: Providers must be enrolled with Anthem NY and adhere to network agreements; out-of-network services may be covered only in emergencies or under specific exceptions.
- **Prior Authorization**: Certain services (e.g., advanced imaging, specialty drugs, inpatient admissions) require pre-authorization. Providers must follow Anthem’s clinical guidelines and submit requests via the provider portal or phone.
- **Billing & Claims**: Claims must be submitted using correct CPT/HCPCS codes and modifiers. Timely filing deadlines apply (typically 180 days from date of service).
- **Exclusions**: Services deemed experimental, investigational, or not medically necessary are generally excluded. Cosmetic procedures and non-covered elective services are also not reimbursed.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary:**

This document is the **Clinical Utilization Management (UM) Guidelines** for **Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid)**, adopted on **February 25, 2021**. It serves as a comprehensive reference for pre-payment medical necessity determinations across a wide range of services, including durable medical equipment (DME), genetic testing, surgical procedures, behavioral health, and diagnostic studies. The guidelines are organized by CUMG (Clinical Utilization Management Guideline) number and title, and are intended to support consistent, evidence-based coverage decisions for Medicaid members. The full guidelines are accessible via Anthem’s online portal: https://www11.anthem.com/ny_search.html.

The policy covers both **newly added** and **existing** clinical services, with specific guidelines for items such as home oxygen therapy, wheelchairs, genetic mutation assays, ketogenesis diets, and surgical interventions like cataract removal or strabismus correction. It also includes guidelines for ancillary services, anesthesia, and diagnostic monitoring tools (e.g., Holter monitors, EEGs, retinal telescreening).

**Key Points:**

- **Scope**: Applies to Medicaid members enrolled in Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP in New York; covers pre-payment medical necessity reviews for services not otherwise addressed by specific clinical guidelines.
- **Coverage Areas**: Includes DME (e.g., wheelchairs, oxygen therapy, prosthetics), genetic testing (e.g., BRAF, JAK2, RAS), surgical procedures (e.g., tonsillectomy, cataract surgery), behavioral health (e.g., adaptive behavioral treatment), and diagnostic/monitoring tools (e.g., EEG, Holter monitors).
- **Access & Updates**: Guidelines are maintained online and are subject to updates; providers must consult the official Anthem portal for the most current version. No individual guideline text is included in this document — only a master list of guideline titles and numbers.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary:**

The *Anthem New York Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) Provider Manual* serves as a comprehensive guide for providers participating in Anthem’s Medicaid MLTC program, which operates in New York City and surrounding counties (Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester). The manual emphasizes Anthem’s commitment to coordinated, culturally competent, home-based care for members, positioning providers as essential partners in achieving positive health outcomes and member satisfaction. It outlines provider responsibilities, credentialing criteria, referral processes, documentation requirements (including physician order forms), and marketing guidelines compliant with New York State regulations. Anthem encourages provider engagement through committee participation and feedback mechanisms, and provides contact information (929-946-6500) for questions or updates.

**Key Points:**

- **Provider Partnership & Engagement**: Anthem views providers as critical partners and invites them to participate in quality assurance committees, provide feedback on initiatives, and complete satisfaction surveys to improve care delivery.
- **Credentialing & Eligibility**: Providers must meet specific criteria for participation, including no involuntary terminations from HMOs/PPOs and no unresolved malpractice or licensing issues (with defined exceptions). Non-physician practitioners have tailored criteria focused on education and training.
- **Referral & Documentation Process**: Referrals must be submitted via the MLTC Provider Portal. Upon receipt, Anthem contacts potential members within 48 hours for eligibility screening, assessment, and enrollment coordination. Physician orders must include detailed medical findings, patient demographics, and be signed within 30 days of examination.

This document is a Prior Authorization (PA) form used by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP for Medicaid members in New York seeking coverage for medical injectables.

This document outlines the **Clinical Utilization Management (UM) Guidelines** adopted by **Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP** for **New York Medicaid** members, effective December 12, 2021. These guidelines govern pre-payment medical necessity determinations for a wide range of services, including durable medical equipment (DME), genetic testing, laboratory services, and medical procedures. The guidelines supersede MCG Care Guidelines when in conflict with Medicaid state contracts, CMS requirements, or Anthem’s own Medical Policy/Clinical UM Guidelines. Medical necessity is determined on a case-by-case basis, with appeals or non-conforming requests referred to licensed physician reviewers. The policy emphasizes adherence to state and federal regulatory frameworks and provides a structured list of CUMG codes and titles for reference.

**Key Points**

- **Medical Necessity Determination**: Decisions are made per case using Medicaid state contracts, CMS rules, or Anthem’s Medical Necessity Criteria Policy (ADMIN.00004); if no guideline exists, CG-ADMIN-01 applies.
- **Physician Review**: Requests not meeting established criteria are escalated to a licensed physician with clinical expertise for adjudication.
- **Scope of Coverage**: Includes DME (e.g., wheelchairs, oxygen therapy, prosthetics), genetic testing (e.g., TP53, BRCA, cardiac conditions), lab tests (e.g., vitamin D, B12, viral panels), and medical services (e.g., home enteral nutrition, EEG, ultrasound).

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This document is the **Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York (NY ABC CAID) Provider Manual**, which outlines policies and procedures for providers serving members enrolled in Medicaid, Child Health Plus (CHPlus), and Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC)/Medicaid Advantage Plus (MAP) programs in New York City and surrounding counties. Anthem operates as a Prepaid Health Service Plan (PHSP) under state and federal Medicaid guidelines, requiring providers to comply with all applicable regulations. The manual covers provider responsibilities, utilization review, prior authorization, claims submission (electronic and paper), reimbursement rules for implants, anesthesia, lab services, and equipment/supplies, and behavioral health program standards. Anthem emphasizes care coordination, individualized treatment, and adherence to state agency guidelines (e.g., OMH, OASAS, OCFS). The manual is subject to change, and providers are encouraged to verify they have the most current version via email.

**Key Points**

- **Compliance & Updates**: Providers must follow all New York State Medicaid and federal guidelines. Anthem updates policies regularly and notifies providers via mail, phone, or email. The most current manual can be requested at nyproviderrequests@anthem.com.
- **Utilization Review & Authorization**: Anthem may delegate UR to accredited agents. Providers must use the Precertification Lookup Tool (PLUTO) or call 800-474-3530 for notifications. Timeframes follow the most stringent of NCQA or NYS Article 49 requirements.
- **Claims & Reimbursement**: Electronic claims via Availity or EFT (via EnrollSafe) are preferred. Paper claims must use original red UB-04 or CMS-1500 forms, submitted within 90 days. Implants are reimbursable only if permanently placed and remain at discharge; IV sedation/local anesthesia by the procedure provider is bundled, but medications are reimbursable. Many supplies (e.g., EKG electrodes, suction supplies, anesthesia equipment) are non-reimbursable.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem policy governs the authorization process for psychological testing under New York Medicaid and Medicare Advantage programs. It emphasizes that formal psychological testing is not routinely covered for screening or brief assessments, which are considered part of standard diagnostic evaluations. Testing must be clinically justified and supported by prior clinical assessments, including interviews, rating scales, and record reviews. Requests for educational, forensic, or placement-related testing are explicitly excluded and should be directed to appropriate public systems (e.g., schools). Providers must complete and submit this form electronically via Availity or by fax, including detailed clinical rationale, symptom history, treatment history, and prior testing results to support medical necessity.

**Key Points**  
- **Coverage Criteria**: Psychological testing is only covered when clinically necessary and cannot be addressed by standard diagnostic tools (e.g., interviews, rating scales).  
- **Exclusions**: Educational testing, forensic evaluations, and placement assessments are not covered; providers must refer these to public school systems or other appropriate entities.  
- **Authorization Requirements**: Providers must document completed clinical assessments (e.g., interviews, rating scales, record reviews), symptom duration, treatment history, and rationale for testing, including how results will impact treatment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-06057, effective 11/04/2024) outlines coverage and billing guidelines for abortion services. It permits reimbursement for induced abortions unless restricted by state, federal, or CMS mandates. Reimbursement is based on applicable fee schedules or negotiated rates. Importantly, the policy distinguishes between elective/induced abortions and medically necessary procedures such as incomplete, missed, or septic abortions — for which informed consent is not required. Providers must use correct CPT, HCPCS, or revenue codes supported by medical documentation. Failure to follow coding or policy guidelines may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers unless superseded by contractual or regulatory requirements.

**Key Points**  
- ✅ Reimbursement is allowed for induced abortions unless prohibited by state/federal law or CMS requirements.  
- ⚠️ Informed consent is not required for medically necessary abortions (incomplete, missed, septic).  
- 📋 Proper coding (CPT/HCPCS/revenue codes) with full medical record support is mandatory; non-compliance may lead to claim denial or recoupment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) policy, effective December 19, 2023, outlines reimbursement guidelines for assistant surgeons using CPT modifiers 80, 81, 82, and AS. The policy permits reimbursement for one assistant surgeon per eligible procedure, provided the appropriate modifier is billed. Reimbursement is a percentage of the primary surgeon’s allowable fee: 20% for modifiers 80, 82, and AS; 16% for modifier 81. The assistant must bill the same procedure code as the primary surgeon unless the primary bills a global code, in which case the assistant bills the specific surgery code with the modifier. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and is subject to state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**  
- **Reimbursement Rates**: Modifier 80 (full assistance) = 20%; Modifier 81 (minimal assistance) = 16%; Modifier 82 (no resident available) = 20%; Modifier AS (non-physician assistant) = 20%.  
- **Billing Rules**: Assistant must bill same CPT code as primary surgeon unless primary bills global code; multiple procedures follow same fee reductions as primary surgeon.  
- **Compliance & Penalties**: Incorrect modifier use may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjusted reimbursement; providers must follow coding guidelines and maintain supporting documentation.

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York policy (G-06030), effective May 6, 2025, outlines the required information and submission standards for institutional providers (facilities) submitting claims for Medicaid services. The policy mandates the use of the UB-04/CMS-1450 form (or its electronic equivalent) and specifies detailed data elements that must be included to ensure claim acceptance and reimbursement. Failure to comply may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes adherence to coding standards (CPT, HCPCS, revenue codes) and medical record support. Electronic submission via EDI is preferred, though paper claims are accepted if legible and properly formatted.

**Key Points**  
- **Required Claim Form**: Facilities must submit UB-04/CMS-1450 (or electronic equivalent) with all applicable fields completed; claims lacking required data may be denied or delayed.  
- **Mandatory Data Elements**: Includes patient demographics, diagnosis/procedure codes (ICD-10, CPT/HCPCS), revenue codes, NPI, CLIA number, COB information, and state-specific reporting fields (e.g., admission source, NDC).  
- **Submission Standards**: Electronic claims via EDI are preferred; paper claims must be original, legible, and printed in dark, large font for OCR processing — altered or illegible claims will be rejected.

This Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield (NY) policy, titled *Claims Submission — Required Information for Professional Providers* (Policy #G-06029), outlines the mandatory documentation and formatting requirements for professional providers submitting claims for Medicaid and other covered services in New York. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes accurate, complete, and compliant claim submissions using the CMS-1500 form (or its electronic equivalent). Claims must include detailed patient, provider, service, and billing information, including ICD-10 codes, CPT/HCPCS codes, NPIs, and NDCs where applicable. Failure to comply may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment. The policy also notes that electronic submission via EDI is preferred, though paper claims are accepted if legible and properly formatted for OCR processing. Providers are directed to consult provider manuals and state-specific guidelines for additional details.

**Key Points:**

- **Required Claim Form**: Must use original CMS-1500 or electronic equivalent; altered claims will be returned.
- **Mandatory Fields**: Includes patient/insured info, ICD-10/CPT/HCPCS codes, NPIs (rendering, billing, referring), NDCs, place of service, dates, charges, and signature on file.
- **Submission Format**: Electronic (EDI) preferred; paper claims must be legible, printed in dark font, and use drop-out red ink to ensure OCR readability — illegible claims will be denied.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) policy, titled *Claims Requiring Additional Documentation* (Policy #G-06031, effective 06/02/2022), outlines the documentation requirements providers must meet for certain claims to be adjudicated. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes that proper coding (CPT, HCPCS, revenue codes) and medical record support are mandatory. Failure to submit required documentation may result in claim denial, recoupment of payments, or adjustment of reimbursement. The policy also notes that Anthem may request additional documentation for claims under review for medical necessity, fraud, billing inconsistencies, or regulatory compliance (e.g., CMS or state mandates). Providers are directed to consult the Anthem provider website for the most current version of the policy.

**Key Points**

- **Documentation Required for Specific Claims**: Providers must submit additional documentation for claims involving unlisted/miscellaneous codes, clinical review, medical necessity conflicts, OHI, DMEPOS, home health, informed consent, certificates of medical necessity, appeals, or regulatory requirements.
- **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Failure to provide requested documentation may lead to claim denial, recoupment of prior payments, or reimbursement adjustment — with no liability for interest or penalties by Anthem.
- **Billing & Coding Compliance**: Claims must use industry-standard codes fully supported by medical records; non-compliance may trigger denial or recoupment, even if services were medically necessary.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield (NY Medicaid) policy, titled “Claims Timely Filing” (Policy #G-06050), outlines the timeframes within which providers must submit claims for reimbursement. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and facilities. Claims must be submitted within 90 calendar days for participating providers and 15 months for non-participating providers, unless superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates. Timely filing is calculated from the date of service (or last day of service for consecutive services) or from the date of the Explanation of Payment (EOP) if another insurer is primary. Claims submitted beyond these limits are generally denied unless the provider can prove a “clean claim” was submitted within the deadline. The policy also allows for temporary waivers during natural disasters or under state guidance. Reimbursement is contingent on proper coding (CPT, HCPCS, revenue codes), medical necessity, and authorization — not merely on timely filing.

**Key Points**

- **Timely Filing Deadlines**: 90 days for participating providers; 15 months for non-participating providers (calendar days).
- **Exceptions**: Claims may be accepted beyond deadlines if a “clean claim” was filed timely; waivers may be granted for natural disasters or state directives.
- **Reimbursement Conditions**: Timely filing alone does not guarantee payment — claims must also meet coding, medical necessity, and authorization requirements.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
Anthem’s Code and Clinical Editing Guidelines (CCEG) are applied to evaluate claims for accuracy, adherence to national coding standards (including CMS NCCI edits), and alignment with plan benefits. These guidelines are enforced via automated software tools that ensure consistent payment and correct billing practices. CCEG includes code editing software, NCCI edits (PTP and MUE), clinical criteria, licensed medical review, and claims processing platforms. Anthem customizes CCEG only for compelling business reasons and updates the guidelines as needed to reflect new codes or rule changes. Claims submitted after a system update are processed under the latest CCEG; no retrospective adjustments are made for new edits, and members are not held responsible for denied or reduced payments due to CCEG enforcement.

**Key Points**  
- **Automated Adjudication**: Anthem uses coding algorithms to auto-adjudicate Evaluation and Management (E/M) claims based on diagnosis complexity.  
- **MUE Enforcement**: Claims exceeding Medically Unlikely Edits (MUE) are denied; no payment is made for conflicting services.  
- **No Member Liability**: Members are not balance billed for services denied or reduced under CCEG; retrospective payment adjustments are not made for new edits.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield (NY ABC CAID) Reimbursement Policy (G-05006) outlines guidelines for reimbursing face-to-face medical consultations performed by physicians or qualified nonphysician practitioners. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers unless superseded by state, federal, or CMS contracts. Reimbursement is based on CPT or state Medicaid guidelines and requires strict documentation, including a written or oral request from the attending provider, a personal patient examination, and a detailed written report from the consultant. Consultations must be medically necessary and properly coded; failure to follow guidelines may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjusted reimbursement. The policy also clarifies that routine screenings and standard pre/postoperative care do not qualify as consultations unless specific conditions are met.

**Key Points**  
- **Eligibility**: Consultations must be requested by the attending provider, include a personal exam, and be documented with a written report including history, findings, and recommendations.  
- **Coding & Billing**: Must use CPT/HCPCS codes with appropriate modifiers (e.g., Modifier 25 or 57) if a therapeutic procedure is performed on the same day; otherwise, the consultation is bundled and not separately reimbursable.  
- **Exclusions**: Routine screenings, standard pre/postoperative care (e.g., history/physical, services with Modifiers 55/56), and concurrent care by the same provider do not qualify as reimbursable consultations.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP policy (G-16001), effective July 23, 2021, outlines the requirements for submitting corrected claims under New York Medicaid. It applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes adherence to timely filing limits and proper claim marking. Corrected claims must be submitted within 60 days of the original payment (Explanation of Payment/Remittance Advice) and must be clearly labeled as “Corrected Claim” if submitted on paper, or use the appropriate frequency code (7 or 8) if submitted electronically. Claims submitted beyond the timely filing window will be denied unless documentation proves timely submission. Anthem may waive filing requirements temporarily following natural disasters or under state guidance. Corrected claims must be submitted individually per member and episode of care — batch or bulk submissions are not accepted.

**Key Points**

- ✅ **Timely Filing**: Corrected claims must be submitted within 60 days of the original payment (EOB/RA) to be considered timely; otherwise, they will be denied.
- ✅ **Proper Marking**: Paper claims must be clearly marked “Corrected Claim”; electronic claims must use frequency codes 7 (replacement) or 8 (void/cancel).
- ❌ **No Batch Submissions**: Corrected claims must be submitted individually per member and episode of care — bulk or packaged submissions are not accepted.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP policy (G-13002) outlines reimbursement rules for inpatient facility transfers under Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) payment systems. It applies when a member is admitted to one acute care facility and subsequently transferred to another acute care facility for the same episode of care. The policy ensures that both the sending (transferring) and receiving facilities are reimbursed, with the transferring facility paid a per diem rate (capped at what would have been paid if the patient had not transferred), and the receiving facility paid the full DRG rate. Proper discharge status coding is required on the transferring facility’s claim to indicate the transfer. The policy is subject to override by provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts.

**Key Points**  
- **Dual Facility Reimbursement**: Both transferring and receiving acute care facilities are paid for services rendered during the same episode of care.  
- **Payment Structure**: Transferring facility receives a per diem rate (capped at full DRG amount); receiving facility receives full DRG payment.  
- **Coding Requirement**: Must use correct discharge status code on transferring facility’s claim to indicate transfer to another acute care facility.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP policy (G-17001) governs reimbursement for newborn inpatient stays billed under Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) methodology. It applies to both participating and non-participating facilities and emphasizes accurate coding and documentation to ensure proper DRG assignment. Reimbursement is contingent on using appropriate revenue codes: “well baby” codes for normal newborn DRGs and “sick baby” codes for sick newborn DRGs. Claims lacking a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) revenue code will not group to a sick newborn DRG. The policy also references adherence to state, federal, and CMS contracts, and notes that authorization guidelines for newborn stays must be followed. The policy was last updated November 17, 2023, and became effective August 12, 2020.

**Key Points**  
- Reimbursement for newborn inpatient stays is allowed unless overridden by provider, state, federal, or CMS contracts.  
- Claims must use correct revenue codes: “well baby” for normal newborn DRGs, “sick baby” for sick newborn DRGs; missing NICU revenue codes prevent sick newborn DRG assignment.  
- Claims must follow standard coding (CPT, HCPCS, revenue codes) and be fully supported by medical records; non-compliance may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy #G-15001, effective 04/12/2022, last updated 05/22/2024) outlines guidelines for billing distinct procedural services using modifiers 59, XE, XP, XS, and XU (collectively referred to as X{EPSU}). The policy supports reimbursement for procedures that are distinct or independent from other services performed on the same day by the same provider, provided they are appropriately coded and meet CMS National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) guidelines. Modifier 59 should only be used when no more specific X{EPSU} modifier (XE, XP, XS, XU) is applicable. Anthem may conduct post-payment reviews and request supporting documentation; failure to provide adequate documentation may result in claim denial or recoupment of payment. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and is subject to state, federal, or CMS contract requirements.

**Key Points**

- **Modifier Hierarchy**: Modifier 59 should only be used if no more descriptive X{EPSU} modifier (XE, XP, XS, XU) is available. Modifiers XE (separate encounter), XP (separate practitioner), XS (separate structure), and XU (unusual non-overlapping service) are preferred when applicable.
- **NCCI Compliance**: Claims must comply with CMS NCCI PTP edits; modifiers may be appended to either the paid or denied code in Column 1/Column 2 edit pairs.
- **Documentation & Review**: Anthem may request medical records or additional documentation to support claims with these modifiers. Failure to provide documentation may result in claim denial or recoupment of payment, with no liability for interest or penalties.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP policy (G-11004, effective 12/30/2024) outlines documentation standards required for reimbursement of Medicaid services in New York. It applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes that documentation must support medical necessity, proper coding, and timely submission. The policy mandates that medical records for each episode of care be legible, complete, dated, timed, and include member identification and provider signature/credentials. Documentation must reflect all aspects of care, including history, exams, orders, medications, labs, imaging, surgical reports, and coordination of care. Failure to meet these standards may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment. The policy references CMS guidelines, state Medicaid rules, and The Joint Commission standards as foundational references.

**Key Points**

- **Documentation Requirements**: Must be legible, dated, timed, include member ID on each page, and signed/identified by the rendering provider within 30 days of service (with time noted for hospital services).
- **Content Requirements**: Must include at minimum: member ID, consent forms, health history, physical exams, orders, immunizations, medications, emergency care, substance use history, face-to-face evaluations, progress notes, referrals, consults, labs, imaging, surgical reports, admission/discharge info, preventive services, and evidence of care coordination.
- **Compliance & Consequences**: Non-compliance may lead to claim denial, recoupment, or reimbursement adjustment. Anthem is not liable for penalties or interest if payment is denied due to missing documentation.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) reimbursement policy (G-19001, effective 08/06/2024) outlines coverage for drug screen testing, including presumptive (qualitative) and definitive (quantitative) testing. The policy allows reimbursement for properly ordered tests unless superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates. When both presumptive and definitive testing are performed on the same date by an independent lab (POS 81), separate reimbursement is allowed for definitive testing of 1–7 drug classes; 8+ classes require a subsequent provider order and are not separately reimbursed on the same day. Specimen validity testing is explicitly bundled into presumptive/definitive codes and is not reimbursed separately. Providers must document medical necessity and proper ordering, especially when definitive testing is confirmatory of presumptive results.

**Key Points**  
- ✅ Reimbursement allowed for properly ordered presumptive and definitive drug testing, subject to state/federal/CMS rules.  
- ⚠️ Definitive testing for 8+ drug classes on same day as presumptive testing requires a new provider order and is not separately reimbursed.  
- ❌ Specimen validity testing is bundled into CPT/HCPCS codes for drug screening and is not reimbursed separately — no modifiers override this.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-06032, effective 04/11/2022, last approved 05/22/2024) addresses billing for duplicate or subsequent services rendered on the same date of service. The policy permits reimbursement for such services only when billed with appropriate CPT/HCPCS modifiers that indicate the service was medically necessary, distinct, or repeated under valid clinical circumstances. Claims lacking these modifiers — whether submitted on the same or separate claims — will be denied. The policy also addresses unbundling of services from comprehensive procedures, which may be denied via code editing if billed together, or reviewed if submitted separately. Providers must use industry-standard codes and ensure documentation supports billed services. Noncompliance may result in claim denial, recoupment, or reimbursement adjustment.

**Key Points**

- **Modifier Requirement**: Duplicate or subsequent services on the same date must be billed with appropriate modifiers (e.g., 25, 59, 76, 77, 91, XE, XS, XU) to indicate distinct, repeat, or separately identifiable services; otherwise, claims will be denied.
- **Bundled Services**: Unbundling a component service from a comprehensive procedure on the same date may trigger automatic denial if billed together; if billed separately, claims are subject to manual review.
- **Compliance & Consequences**: Failure to follow coding/billing guidelines may result in claim rejection, recoupment of payments, or adjustment of reimbursement. Policies may be superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) policy, effective January 16, 2024, outlines reimbursement guidelines for facility-based Emergency Department (ED) Evaluation and Management (E/M) services. The policy emphasizes that reimbursement is determined by Anthem’s classification of ED E/M code levels, based on the intensity and complexity of resources and interventions used during the visit — not solely on the code submitted by the provider. Providers must use HIPAA-compliant CPT, HCPCS, or revenue codes supported by medical documentation. Anthem reserves the right to adjust, deny, or recoup payments if the billed level exceeds the level supported by the claim. The policy excludes cases involving critical care, outpatient surgery, patient death in the ED, inpatient admission, transfer, or observation status. It aligns with EMTALA and references ACEP, CMS, and state Medicaid guidelines.

**Key Points**  
- **Reimbursement Determination**: Based on Anthem’s classification of ED E/M levels using facility resource intensity/complexity — not provider-billed code alone.  
- **Claim Adjustments**: Anthem may deny, adjust, or recoup payment if the billed E/M level is unsupported by documentation or exceeds the classified level.  
- **Exclusions**: Services involving critical care, outpatient surgery, patient death, inpatient admission, transfer, or observation status are not eligible for ED E/M leveling reimbursement.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP reimbursement policy (G-06049) outlines coverage and billing guidelines for Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) services under New York Medicaid. Effective May 1, 2020, and last approved June 9, 2023, the policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers. It emphasizes that reimbursement is contingent upon adherence to coding, billing, and medical necessity guidelines, and that services must be supported by documentation. EPSDT services are generally bundled into preventive medicine E/M visits unless Modifier 25 is used to indicate a separate, significant E/M service. Certain component services — such as developmental, hearing, vision, and lab screenings — are separately reimbursable when billed with Modifier EP. Providers must follow AAP and CDC periodicity schedules and include specific indicators and codes on claims.

**Key Points**

- **Coverage Scope**: EPSDT services are reimbursed per applicable fee schedules or contracted rates, unless superseded by state/federal mandates or CMS requirements.
- **Bundled vs. Separate Billing**: Comprehensive health history, physical exam, health education, nutritional assessment, and dental screening are bundled into preventive E/M visits; developmental screening, hearing, vision, immunizations, urinalysis, and specific lab tests are separately billable with Modifier EP.
- **Claims Requirements**: Claims must include EPSDT Special Program Indicator, appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes, E/M codes, and Modifier EP for component services. Non-compliance may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York (NY ABC CAID) policy, titled “Eligible Billed Charges” (Policy #G-06001, effective 11/04/2024), outlines the conditions under which providers may be reimbursed for services rendered to Medicaid members. The policy emphasizes that reimbursement is contingent upon multiple factors including member and provider eligibility, benefit coverage, prior authorization, adherence to coding and billing standards (CPT, HCPCS, revenue codes), and compliance with clinical, administrative, and contractual guidelines. Reimbursement amounts are determined by applicable fee schedules or negotiated rates, adjusted for copays, deductibles, and coordination of benefits. The policy explicitly states that Anthem will not reimburse for items provided free of charge to the member or received free by the provider. In the absence of specific contractual language, terms like “billed charges” or “allowed charges” default to “eligible charges.” The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers unless superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**

- **Reimbursement Eligibility**: Services must meet member eligibility, benefit coverage, authorization, coding, and clinical policy requirements to be eligible for reimbursement.
- **Non-Reimbursable Items**: Providers are not reimbursed for items they receive or provide free of charge to the member.
- **Coding & Billing Compliance**: Claims must use standard CPT, HCPCS, or revenue codes fully supported by medical documentation; non-compliance may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield policy (NY_ABC_CAID_RP_FacilityTakeHome.pdf) outlines reimbursement rules for durable medical equipment (DME) and medical supplies dispensed by hospital facilities for take-home use by Medicaid members in New York. Anthem generally does not reimburse facilities for such items unless mandated by state, federal, or CMS contracts. Instead, claims for take-home DME and supplies must be submitted by a contracted DME/supply vendor. Reimbursement is based on negotiated rates for participating vendors or out-of-network fee schedules for nonparticipating vendors. Limited exceptions allow facility reimbursement for crutches and up to 72 hours of medical supplies at discharge if a vendor could not be secured.

**Key Points**  
- **Reimbursement Restriction**: Facility claims for take-home DME/supplies (billed with revenue codes indicating take-home use) are denied unless required by contract or regulation.  
- **Vendor Submission Required**: Take-home DME/supplies must be billed by a DME/supply vendor to be eligible for reimbursement.  
- **Limited Facility Exceptions**: Facilities may bill for crutches and ≤72 hours of supplies at discharge if vendor access was not feasible.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) policy, titled “Genetic Tests: Once per Lifetime” (Policy #G-23002), establishes that specific germline genetic sequencing tests are reimbursable only once per member’s lifetime. The policy is effective January 1, 2024, and applies to Medicaid services administered by Anthem in New York. It clarifies that while a person’s germline genotype does not change over time, reinterpretation of existing genetic data — due to evolving variant classifications or new clinical evidence — does not justify repeat sequencing. Reinterpretation of prior results is not separately reimbursable. The policy emphasizes adherence to proper coding (CPT/HCPCS) and medical necessity guidelines, and notes that reimbursement is contingent on compliance with state, federal, or contractual mandates.

**Key Points**

- **Lifetime Limitation**: Genetic sequencing procedures (germline) are reimbursed only once per lifetime per member, unless overridden by state/federal contracts.
- **No Reimbursement for Reinterpretation**: Reanalysis or reinterpretation of previously sequenced data is not a separately billable service.
- **Coding & Compliance Required**: Claims must use industry-standard codes (CPT/HCPCS) and be fully supported by medical records; non-compliance may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy (G-06041) outlines the reimbursement rules for the **Global Surgical Package**, effective January 30, 2023, and last approved June 3, 2025. The policy follows CMS global surgery indicator codes (including XXX, YYY, ZZZ) and applies to both minor (0- or 10-day postoperative period) and major (90-day postoperative period) surgical procedures. Reimbursement for the global package includes preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative services typically rendered by the operating surgeon or same-specialty group members — including non-physician providers (NPPs). Services such as preoperative E/M visits, intraoperative supplies, anesthesia, and routine postoperative visits are bundled and not separately reimbursable unless specific exceptions apply. The policy also clarifies what is *not* included in the global package (e.g., unrelated visits, diagnostic tests, distinct procedures, critical care, therapy services) and requires use of HIPAA-compliant modifiers for postoperative services.

**Key Points**

- **Global Package Inclusions**: Preoperative care (starting day before surgery for major, day of for minor), intraoperative services (supplies, drugs, anesthesia, moderate sedation), and routine postoperative visits related to surgical recovery — all bundled and not separately billable when provided by the same surgeon/group.
- **Exclusions & Exceptions**: Services unrelated to the surgical diagnosis, diagnostic tests, distinct surgical procedures, treatment of complications requiring return to OR, immunosuppressive therapy, critical care, physical/occupational/speech therapy, and surgical clearance by non-treating providers are *not* included and may be billed separately.
- **Modifiers & Unlisted Codes**: Providers must use appropriate HIPAA-compliant modifiers for postoperative services. Unlisted surgical procedures (YYY) are reviewed on a case-by-case basis for reimbursement.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) reimbursement policy (G-06164, effective 07/17/2024) outlines coverage criteria for hysterectomy procedures. Reimbursement is allowed for nonelective, medically necessary hysterectomies when performed to treat illness or injury. The policy emphasizes strict documentation requirements, including a signed, state-approved Consent/Acknowledgement of Hysterectomy form, which must confirm the member’s understanding that the procedure will render them permanently incapable of reproduction. Exceptions exist for emergency cases or pre-existing sterility, where physician certification may substitute for prior consent. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and is subject to state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**  
- ✅ Reimbursement requires medical necessity, informed consent, and a signed state-approved consent form — regardless of diagnosis or age.  
- ⚠️ In emergencies or if the patient was already sterile, a physician-certified form may be accepted in lieu of prior consent.  
- ❌ Reimbursement is denied if the hysterectomy is performed primarily to render the patient permanently incapable of reproduction or for cancer prophylaxis (unless medically necessary for treatment).

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid Reimbursement Policy (G-14001), effective July 7, 2023, outlines billing and reimbursement guidelines for maternity services under the global obstetrical care package. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes that global obstetrical codes (covering antepartum, delivery, and postpartum care) may be billed only once per pregnancy (279 days) by a single provider or group under the same Tax Identification Number (TIN). If services are fragmented across providers or not fully delivered by one entity, only the actual services rendered may be billed. Duplicate or overlapping services during the same pregnancy are not reimbursed. The policy also details what is and is not included in the global package, including specific exclusions such as high-risk antepartum visits (beyond 13), maternal/fetal diagnostics, and certain procedures like amniocentesis or external cephalic version. Providers must use appropriate diagnosis codes indicating gestational age and delivery outcome to avoid claim denial.

**Key Points**

- **Global Package Billing**: Reimbursement for global obstetrical codes is allowed only once per pregnancy by a single provider/group under the same TIN; fragmented care requires itemized billing of only services rendered.
- **Excluded Services**: High-risk antepartum visits beyond 13, maternal/fetal diagnostics (e.g., amniocentesis, echocardiography), and procedures like external cephalic version or amnioinfusion may be billed separately.
- **Coding & Documentation Requirements**: Providers must use correct CPT/HCPCS codes, append Modifier 25 for additional E/M visits, and report diagnosis codes indicating gestational age and delivery outcome; failure to do so may result in claim denial or recoupment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP reimbursement policy (G-15003), effective June 16, 2021, establishes limits on the maximum number of units per day that may be billed for a single procedure or service for one member by the same provider or provider group. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and is based on claims data analysis. If billed units exceed the daily maximum, those excess units are not eligible for reimbursement unless supported by appropriate documentation. The policy does not override NCCI edits or state/federal/CMS mandates, which may supersede it. Anthem reserves the right to recoup payments if policy updates are delayed and to revise policies as needed.

**Key Points**  
- **Maximum Units Per Day**: Anthem sets a daily unit cap per procedure/service per member per provider; excess units are not reimbursed unless documented and justified.  
- **Documentation Requirement**: Providers must submit supporting documentation if billing beyond the daily unit limit for potential reimbursement consideration.  
- **Policy Supersedence**: State, federal, or CMS contracts may override this policy; NCCI edits remain unaffected by this unit limit policy.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP reimbursement policy (G-06111), effective May 22, 2024, addresses coverage for services related to medical recalls. Anthem generally does not reimburse for the repair or replacement of recalled medical items (e.g., durable medical equipment, prosthetics, implantable devices, drugs/vaccines) unless mandated by provider contracts, state/federal law, or CMS requirements. However, Anthem will reimburse for medically necessary procedures to remove and replace recalled devices. If a provider or facility receives credit from a manufacturer for a recalled device, Anthem will reduce reimbursement by that credit amount. Anthem also reserves the right to recoup payments from providers or manufacturers if overpayments occurred due to recalls.

**Key Points**  
- **No reimbursement for recall-related repairs/replacements** unless required by contract or regulation.  
- **Reimbursement allowed for medically necessary removal/replacement procedures** of recalled devices.  
- **Recoupment rights**: Anthem may recover payments from providers or manufacturers if credits were received for recalled items.  
- **Billing requirements**: Providers must use appropriate condition codes, modifiers, or diagnosis codes to identify recalled items.  
- **Documentation & compliance**: Claims must use correct CPT/HCPCS/revenue codes and be fully supported by medical records.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield reimbursement policy (G-15004), effective October 30, 2023, outlines guidelines for billing and reimbursement of the professional component (Modifier 26) and technical component (Modifier TC) of global procedures. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers unless superseded by state, federal, or CMS contracts. Reimbursement is based on applicable fee schedules or negotiated rates, physician specialty, and place of service. Importantly, physicians or qualified healthcare professionals billing in facility settings (e.g., hospitals, ASCs, psychiatric facilities) are not reimbursed for the technical component — only the facility may bill for TC. Physicians may only bill for the professional component (Modifier 26) in these settings and must coordinate with the facility for any technical component services. Portable X-ray suppliers must bill only with Modifier TC.

**Key Points**

- **Modifier 26 (Professional Component)**: Used when a physician or qualified provider performs only the interpretation/reporting portion of a global service. Reimbursable in facility settings.
- **Modifier TC (Technical Component)**: Used to bill for equipment, supplies, and technical staff services. Only facilities (not physicians) may bill for TC in facility-based settings (POS 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 51, 61).
- **Billing Restrictions**: Physicians billing in facility places of service (e.g., hospital outpatient, ER, ASC) cannot bill for global procedures or TC — only Modifier 26 is allowed. Portable X-ray suppliers must use Modifier TC only.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-07020) addresses the use of **CPT Modifier 22** — “Increased Procedural Services” — for surgical procedures. The policy confirms that Anthem allows reimbursement for procedures billed with Modifier 22, provided they comply with correct coding guidelines and are supported by documentation. Reimbursement is based on 100% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate. Modifier 22 is specifically permitted with surgical procedures that have global periods of 000, 010, 090, or YYY. The policy emphasizes that services must also meet medical necessity and authorization requirements, and that failure to follow billing guidelines may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment. The policy is effective as of September 6, 2024, and applies to both participating and non-participating providers unless superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**  
- ✅ **Modifier 22 is reimbursable** for eligible surgical procedures with global periods 000, 010, 090, or YYY, provided documentation supports increased procedural services.  
- 💰 **Reimbursement is at 100%** of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate — no additional payment beyond the base rate is provided.  
- ⚠️ **Documentation and coding compliance are mandatory** — claims must follow correct coding guidelines and be fully supported in the medical record; non-compliance may lead to denial or recoupment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield policy (NY ABC CAID RP Modifier 62 Co-Surgeons) outlines reimbursement rules for procedures performed by two co-surgeons using Modifier 62. The policy allows payment to each co-surgeon at 62.5% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate, provided they are from different specialties and perform distinct parts of the same procedure during the same operative session. Both surgeons must bill the same procedure code with Modifier 62; failure to do so may result in one surgeon receiving full payment while the other’s claim is denied or pended due to duplication. Assistant surgeon rules (Modifiers 80/81/82) do not apply to Modifier 62 services unless the co-surgeon assists in additional, separate procedures. The policy may be superseded by state, federal, or CMS contracts, and Anthem reserves the right to recoup payments if policy updates are delayed.

**Key Points**  
- ✅ Reimbursement: Each co-surgeon receives 62.5% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate.  
- 🚫 Requirement: Co-surgeons must be from different specialties and bill the same procedure code with Modifier 62.  
- ⚠️ Risk: Incorrect modifier use may lead to claim denial, pendency, or improper full payment to one surgeon.  
- 📌 Exception: If a co-surgeon assists in additional procedures, those may be billed with Modifiers 80 or 82.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy (G-06015) outlines reimbursement guidelines for the use of **CPT Modifier 63**, which is used to report procedures performed on **neonates and infants weighing up to 4 kg**. The modifier indicates significantly increased complexity and physician work associated with treating these patients. Reimbursement is allowed at 100% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate when modifier 63 is appropriately applied. The patient’s weight must be clearly documented in the medical record. The policy also clarifies that modifier 63 is **not reimbursable** when billed with certain code types (e.g., E/M, anesthesia, radiology, pathology, or facility claims) or with codes that already include neonate/infant in their description. Assistant surgeon and multiple procedure rules apply when modifier 63 is used in conjunction with those services.

---

**Key Points**  
- ✅ **Reimbursable**: Modifier 63 is reimbursed for surgical procedures on neonates/infants ≤4 kg, provided weight is documented and the code is not exempt.  
- ❌ **Nonreimbursable**: Modifier 63 is denied when billed with E/M, anesthesia, radiology, pathology, medicine (unless appropriate), facility claims, or with modifier 22 on the same code.  
- ⚖️ **Rules Apply**: Assistant surgeon (modifiers 80/81/82/AS) and multiple procedure (modifiers 50/51) rules still apply when modifier 63 is used.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) reimbursement policy governs the use of **Modifier 66** for surgical team procedures. Modifier 66 is used to identify services performed by multiple physicians or qualified healthcare professionals during highly complex surgeries requiring coordinated, specialized care. Anthem reimburses Modifier 66 at **20% of the fee schedule or contracted rate**, provided the service meets medical necessity and billing guidelines. Each participating physician must bill the applicable procedure code with Modifier 66; failure to do so may result in claim denial or pendency for duplicate services. Prepayment review is conducted, and **documentation must be submitted with claims**—failure to include documentation will result in denial. The policy also clarifies that assistant surgeon rules (Modifiers 80/81/82/AS) do not apply to Modifier 66 claims.

**Key Points**

- **Reimbursement Rate**: Modifier 66 is reimbursed at 20% of the fee schedule or contracted rate.
- **Billing Requirement**: Each physician on the surgical team must bill the procedure code with Modifier 66; improper use may lead to claim denial or pendency.
- **Documentation Mandate**: Claims billed with Modifier 66 require supporting documentation; absence of documentation results in automatic denial.

The policy allows reimbursement for procedures repeated by the same physician on the same date (for facilities) or subsequent to the original (for professionals), provided appropriate documentation is submitted. Reimbursement is 100% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate for nonsurgical services, and for surgical services, only the surgical component is reimbursed — limited to two procedures total. Professional services (excluding radiology) require clinical review and supporting documentation; failure to submit documentation results in claim denial. Modifier 76 is explicitly prohibited for E/M codes, lab codes, more than one repeat, or pre/post-op surgical components.

**Key Points**

- ✅ **Reimbursement Allowed**: Modifier 76 is reimbursable for repeat procedures by the same physician, with 100% payment for nonsurgical services and surgical components (max 2 procedures).
- 📄 **Documentation Required**: Providers must submit clinical documentation supporting the medical necessity of the repeat procedure; claims without documentation will be denied.
- ❌ **Non-Reimbursable Uses**: Modifier 76 is not allowed with E/M codes, lab codes, more than one repeat, or for pre/postoperative surgical components.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem reimbursement policy (G-06019) governs the use of CPT Modifier 77 — “Repeat Procedure by Another Physician” — for both professional and facility claims in New York (NY ABC CAID). The policy, effective October 3, 2018, and last updated August 23, 2023, outlines when Modifier 77 may be appended to procedure codes to indicate a repeat procedure performed by a different provider. Reimbursement is allowed at 100% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate for nonsurgical services, and for the surgical component only (limited to two procedures) for surgical services. Professional services (excluding radiology) require clinical review and supporting documentation; failure to submit documentation results in claim denial. Modifier 77 is explicitly non-reimbursable when used with E/M codes, for more than one repeat, or for pre/postoperative components of surgery.

**Key Points**  
- ✅ Modifier 77 is reimbursable for repeat procedures by another provider on the same day (facility claims) or subsequent to the original (professional claims).  
- 📄 Supporting documentation is mandatory for professional services (except radiology); claims without documentation will be denied.  
- ❌ Modifier 77 is not reimbursable when used with E/M codes, for more than one repeat, or for pre/postoperative surgical components.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) reimbursement policy (G-06016) outlines the conditions under which claims billed with **CPT Modifier 78** — “Unplanned Return to the Operating/Procedure Room by the Same Physician Following Initial Procedure for a Related Procedure During the Postoperative Period” — will be reimbursed. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers, provided they follow proper coding and billing guidelines. Reimbursement is limited to 100% of the maximum fee schedule or contracted rate for the surgical procedure code, and does not include pre- or postoperative care. Claims must be supported by medical documentation and meet medical necessity and authorization requirements. The policy was last approved on 09/27/2023 and became effective 11/16/2018.

**Key Points**  
- ✅ **Reimbursable when**: The return to the OR/procedure room is unplanned, performed by the same physician, related to the initial procedure, and occurs during the postoperative period.  
- ❌ **Nonreimbursable when**: Modifier 78 is appended to nonsurgical codes or codes that already denote “subsequent,” “related,” or “redo” procedures.  
- 💰 **Reimbursement limit**: Based solely on the surgical procedure code; no additional payment for pre- or postoperative care. Assistant surgeon rules apply if applicable.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) policy, effective October 1, 2021, addresses the use of **Modifier 90** for reference (outside) laboratory services. It explicitly prohibits “pass-through billing” — where a provider bills for lab tests performed by an outside lab as if they performed them — unless mandated by state, federal, or CMS contracts. Claims with Modifier 90 billed in Place of Service (POS) 11 (Office) will be denied unless an exception applies. Reimbursement is paid directly to the performing laboratory at 100% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate. The policy does not apply to labs or pathology providers who are permitted to bill in POS 11.

**Key Points**  
- ❌ **Pass-through billing is not allowed** for lab services unless required by state/federal/CMS rules.  
- ❌ **Claims with Modifier 90 in POS 11 (Office) will be denied** unless an exception applies.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield policy (NY ABC CAID RP Modifier 91 Repeat Lab Test) outlines reimbursement guidelines for repeat clinical diagnostic laboratory tests billed with Modifier 91. The policy applies to Medicaid services in New York and permits reimbursement for repeat tests on the same day for the same patient, provided they are medically necessary and supported by documentation. Reimbursement is based on 100% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate. The policy explicitly prohibits the use of Modifier 91 for confirming initial results, correcting specimen/equipment errors, or when other codes already describe a series of test results. Failure to use Modifier 91 appropriately may result in claim denial as a duplicate service. The policy is subject to state, federal, or CMS contract overrides and may be updated as needed.

**Key Points**

- **Modifier 91 Use**: Only permitted for repeat lab tests on the same day to obtain multiple results — not for confirmation, specimen/equipment issues, or when other codes describe a series.
- **Reimbursement**: Paid at 100% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate for the test billed with Modifier 91.
- **Documentation & Compliance**: Medical records must support the use of Modifier 91; improper use may lead to claim denial or recoupment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield New York Medicaid Reimbursement Policy (G-06006, effective 01/16/2024) outlines guidelines for the appropriate use of CPT/HCPCS modifiers in claims submissions. The policy emphasizes that correct modifier usage is essential for reimbursement eligibility, though it does not guarantee payment. Modifiers must be submitted in the correct format (capital letters for alpha/alphanumeric modifiers) and in the primary modifier field when affecting reimbursement. Claims submitted without proper modifiers may be denied or rejected and must be resubmitted with corrections within timely filing limits. Anthem reserves the right to audit high-volume modifiers and recoup payments if coding guidelines are not followed. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and may be superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**  
- **Modifier Accuracy Required**: Claims must include correct modifiers in proper format (capital letters) and position (primary field for reimbursement modifiers); otherwise, claims may be denied or rejected.  
- **Documentation & Resubmission**: Certain modifiers require supporting documentation; denied claims must be corrected and resubmitted within timely filing limits.  
- **No Guarantee of Payment**: Proper modifier use does not ensure reimbursement — services must also meet medical necessity, authorization, and benefit plan criteria.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-06003, effective 05/22/2024) outlines guidelines for billing Evaluation and Management (E/M) services with Modifiers 25 and 57 when performed in conjunction with surgical procedures. Modifier 25 is used to bill a significant, separately identifiable E/M service on the same day as a major or minor surgical procedure, provided it goes beyond routine pre- or post-operative care. Modifier 57 is used when an E/M service on the day prior to or the day of a major surgery results in the initial decision to perform that surgery. Reimbursement for both modifiers is based on 100% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate, contingent upon proper documentation and coding. The policy emphasizes that failure to correctly apply these modifiers may result in claim denial or post-payment review.

**Key Points**

- **Modifier 25**: Reimbursable for significant, separately identifiable E/M services on the same day as a major (90-day global) or minor (0- or 10-day global) surgery, provided documentation supports medical necessity beyond routine care. CPT 99211 is generally nonreimbursable with Modifier 25, except for vaccine administration.
- **Modifier 57**: Reimbursable only for E/M services that result in the *initial decision* to perform a major surgery on the day prior to or day of the procedure. Not reimbursable for minor surgeries or if the surgical decision was made prior to the E/M visit.
- **Documentation & Compliance**: Providers must clearly document the medical necessity and distinct nature of the E/M service. Anthem reserves the right to request medical records and may recoup payments if billing guidelines are not followed.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP reimbursement policy (G-07022) governs the use of CPT/HCPCS modifiers LT (left side) and RT (right side) for procedures performed on specific sides of the body. The policy, effective June 6, 2007, and last updated September 27, 2023, clarifies that these modifiers are informational only and do not affect reimbursement rates — payment remains at 100% of the fee schedule or contracted rate. Modifiers LT and RT should not be used for bilateral procedures or with codes that already specify unilateral or bilateral performance. When both sides are treated in the same session, multiple surgery rules apply. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers, provided they follow standard coding and documentation guidelines.

**Key Points**  
- Modifiers LT and RT are informational only — they do not increase or decrease reimbursement.  
- Do not use LT/RT with bilateral procedure codes or when the code description already includes “bilateral” or “unilateral.”  
- Claims for procedures performed on both sides (using both LT and RT) are subject to multiple surgery rules and may be adjusted accordingly.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) reimbursement policy, effective July 17, 2024, outlines billing and reimbursement guidelines for multiple delivery services (e.g., twins, triplets) performed via same- or combined-delivery methods. The policy applies to both vaginal and cesarean deliveries and specifies the use of CPT modifiers to ensure accurate claims submission. For vaginal deliveries, modifier 51 is required, triggering multiple procedure guidelines. For cesarean deliveries, modifier 22 is used, and multiple procedure guidelines do not apply. The policy emphasizes adherence to coding standards, medical necessity, and authorization requirements, and notes that reimbursement is contingent on compliance with state, federal, and CMS mandates. Non-compliance may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment.

**Key Points**  
- **Vaginal Deliveries**: Bill with modifier 51; multiple procedure guidelines apply.  
- **Cesarean Deliveries**: Bill with modifier 22; multiple procedure guidelines do not apply.  
- **Compliance Required**: Claims must use correct CPT/HCPCS codes, be supported by medical records, and follow state/federal/CMS rules to avoid denial or recoupment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (Policy #G-06010, effective 11/25/2020, last approved 08/28/2023) outlines billing and reimbursement rules for multiple and bilateral surgical procedures. It applies to both professional (physician) and facility providers and aligns with CMS, state Medicaid, and industry coding standards. The policy clarifies when to use CPT Modifiers 50 (bilateral procedure) and 51 (multiple procedures), and specifies reimbursement reductions for multiple procedures performed in the same session. Reimbursement is based on fee schedules or negotiated rates, with specific percentage reductions applied to secondary procedures. The policy also addresses billing for inherently bilateral codes and prohibits modifier use in such cases.

**Key Points**

- **Multiple Surgery Reimbursement**: For multiple procedures performed in the same session, the highest-valued procedure is reimbursed at 100%, secondary through fifth procedures at 50%, and sixth+ procedures at 50% only if medically necessary per clinical review. Professional claims must use Modifier 51; facility claims should not.
- **Bilateral Surgery Reimbursement**: When a unilateral code is used for a bilateral procedure, Modifier 50 must be appended, and reimbursement is 150% of the fee schedule. If the CPT code is inherently bilateral or includes “unilateral or bilateral,” no modifier is used, and reimbursement is 100%.
- **Compliance & Enforcement**: Claims not following coding guidelines may be denied, adjusted, or subject to recoupment. Policies may be superseded by state/federal mandates, and Anthem reserves the right to recoup payments retroactively if delays occur.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy (G-12002, effective 12/10/2024) outlines reimbursement rules for multiple diagnostic imaging procedures performed on the same date by the same provider or provider group during the same patient encounter. It applies only to professional component reimbursement — not facility reimbursement — and targets procedures with a CMS National Physician Fee Schedule (NPFS) Multiple Procedure Indicator (MPI) of 4. The policy implements a Multiple Procedure Payment Reduction (MPPR): the highest-valued procedure is reimbursed at 100%, while subsequent procedures are reimbursed at 60%. Exceptions apply if modifier 59 or X{EPSU} is appropriately used to indicate separate sessions or distinct procedural services. The policy also clarifies that multiple units of a single imaging procedure are subject to the same reduction.

**Key Points**  
- **Applies to professional component only** — facility reimbursement is excluded.  
- **MPPR applies to MPI 4 procedures** — 100% for the highest-valued service, 60% for subsequent services on same date/encounter.  
- **Modifiers 59 or X{EPSU} override reduction** — if used to indicate separate sessions or distinct services.  
- **Multiple units of one procedure are reduced** — even if billed as one CPT code with multiple units.  
- **Policy supersedes prior versions** — updates include MPI 4 language, modifier clarifications, and reimbursement structure refinements.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-20002) outlines coverage and billing guidelines for services provided by Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and Physician Assistants (PAs). Effective November 1, 2024, the policy allows reimbursement for NP services when they are considered physician services, fall within the NP’s scope of practice, and are billed at NP fee schedule rates. PAs are not eligible for separate reimbursement; their services must be billed under the supervising physician’s NPI. Certain services — including drugs, DMEPOS, and laboratory services — are explicitly excluded from payment reduction considerations. Providers must use correct CPT/HCPCS/revenue codes supported by medical documentation. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers unless superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**  
- ✅ Reimbursement is allowed for NPs when services are within scope, considered physician services, and billed at NP rates.  
- ❌ PAs are not reimbursed separately — services must be billed under the supervising physician’s NPI.  
- 🚫 Excluded from payment reduction: drugs, DMEPOS, and laboratory services (including screening tests).

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP reimbursement policy (G-06160) governs coverage for **portable, mobile, and handheld radiology services** provided to Medicaid members in New York. The policy permits reimbursement for radiological services performed in a member’s residence (including private homes, assisted living, nursing, or intermediate care facilities) when the member is medically unable to travel to a facility. Services must be ordered by a physician and performed by qualified, state-licensed suppliers. Reimbursement includes both the radiological procedure and separate payment for transportation and setup of equipment — but only when equipment is physically transported to the member’s residence. Transportation costs are prorated when multiple members are served at the same location, using specific modifiers (UN, UP, UQ, UR, US). Handheld radiology is reimbursable only when performed in the physician’s office and using equipment owned or directly leased by the provider. Services performed for convenience or routine screening are not covered.

**Key Points**

- ✅ **Coverage Conditions**: Reimbursement is allowed for portable/mobile radiology only when medically necessary, performed in the member’s residence, and ordered by a physician.
- 🚫 **Exclusions**: Transportation costs are not reimbursed if equipment is stored on-site (e.g., in a nursing home) for on-demand use. If the radiology service itself is not covered, transportation/setup fees are also denied.
- 📊 **Billing Requirements**: Use appropriate CPT/HCPCS codes with modifiers (UN–US) to indicate number of patients served at one location for prorated transportation reimbursement. No modifier needed for single-patient visits.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid reimbursement policy addresses **Preventable Adverse Events (PAEs)**, which include **Health Care-Acquired Conditions (HCACs)** and **Other Provider Preventable Conditions (OPPCs)**. The policy states that Anthem generally **does not reimburse** for PAEs unless mandated otherwise by provider contracts, state, federal, or CMS requirements. For HCACs, providers must submit **Present on Admission (POA) indicators** with inpatient claims to identify whether a condition existed prior to admission. If an HCAC is identified as acquired during care, reimbursement may be reduced or denied — unless the condition predated treatment by the provider. For OPPCs (e.g., wrong-site, wrong-patient, or wrong-procedure surgeries), claims are typically **rejected or denied**, and specific modifiers (PA, PB, PC) and ICD-10 codes (Y65.51–Y65.53) must be used. Claims may be subject to clinical review, and Anthem reserves the right to request additional documentation.

**Key Points**  
- **No reimbursement for PAEs**: Anthem does not pay for HCACs or OPPCs unless required by contract or regulation.  
- **POA indicator required**: All inpatient diagnoses (except admitting diagnosis) must include POA indicators; failure to do so may result in claim denial.  
- **OPPCs trigger claim denial**: Wrong-site, wrong-patient, or wrong-procedure events are denied unless pre-existing; specific modifiers and ICD-10 codes must be used.  
- **Exemptions apply**: Certain facilities (e.g., critical access hospitals, psychiatric hospitals) are exempt from POA reporting under Medicare methodology.  
- **Documentation & recoupment**: Anthem may recoup payments if policies are not followed, and may request additional records for review.

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy (G-05016), effective May 22, 2024, outlines reimbursement guidelines for providers who deliver both preventive medicine services and sick visits on the same day. The policy permits reimbursement for both services when billed correctly, provided they meet medical necessity and authorization criteria. Reimbursement is based on the applicable fee schedule or negotiated rates, with the key requirement that Modifier 25 must be appended to the evaluation and management (E/M) code for the sick visit to indicate a significant, separately identifiable service. Appropriate diagnosis codes must also be submitted for each visit. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Centers (RHCs) reimbursed outside Anthem’s fee schedule or state encounter rates are exempt from this policy.

**Key Points**  
- **Modifier 25 Required**: The sick visit E/M code must include Modifier 25 to be reimbursed; failure to do so results in denial.  
- **Diagnosis Coding**: Separate, appropriate diagnosis codes must be billed for the preventive and sick visits.  
- **Exclusions**: FQHCs and RHCs reimbursed via alternative methods (not Anthem’s fee schedule or state encounter rates) are not subject to this policy.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield New York Medicaid Reimbursement Policy (G-07018), effective November 6, 2020, outlines coverage and reimbursement guidelines for professional anesthesia services. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes adherence to CMS guidelines, proper coding (CPT/HCPCS), and documentation of anesthesia time in minutes. Reimbursement is calculated using CMS-based formulas and requires accurate use of anesthesia modifiers to identify the provider type and service performed. The policy also addresses specific scenarios such as multiple procedures, obstetrical anesthesia (capped at 300 minutes unless additional documentation is provided), and separately reimbursable services like Swan-Ganz catheter insertion or emergency intubation. Services must be medically necessary and authorized per member-specific benefit plans.

**Key Points**

- **Time-Based Billing**: Anesthesia services must be reported in minutes, with start/stop times documented in the medical record; claims not in minutes may be denied.
- **Modifiers Required**: Appropriate anesthesia modifiers (e.g., Modifier 47 for surgeon-administered anesthesia) must be used in the primary modifier field; failure to do so results in denial.
- **Nonreimbursable Services**: Patient status modifiers and qualifying circumstance codes indicating complexity are not reimbursed.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP reimbursement policy (G-06133, effective 11/19/2021, last approved 09/27/2023) outlines the requirements for providers to demonstrate “Proof of Timely Filing” when a claim is initially denied for late submission. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes that timely filing is a prerequisite for reimbursement, even if the service was medically necessary and authorized. Providers may request reconsideration of a denied claim if they can either prove the claim was received within the timely filing window or demonstrate “Good Cause” for the delay. The policy also specifies acceptable and unacceptable forms of documentation based on submission method (mail, electronic, fax, or hand delivery) and defines what constitutes “Good Cause,” including administrative errors, retroactive enrollment, or unavoidable third-party delays.

**Key Points**  
- **Reconsideration Eligibility**: Claims denied for late filing may be reconsidered if the provider submits proof of timely receipt or demonstrates “Good Cause” for the delay.  
- **Acceptable Proof**: For mailed claims, official return receipt + claim log; for electronic claims, clearinghouse receipt date from reconciliation reports. Fax and hand delivery logs are *not* accepted.  
- **Good Cause Examples**: Includes administrative errors by official sources, retroactive member enrollment, incorrect member-provided info leading to misfiling, or unavoidable delays in obtaining third-party documentation.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-06084, effective 10/24/2024) outlines coverage criteria for prosthetic and orthotic devices. Reimbursement is allowed when devices are ordered by a physician or qualified provider and used in accepted medical practice. Coverage includes the full scope of services related to the device — design, fabrication, fitting, and training — which are bundled into the device’s reimbursement and not billed separately. Repairs are reimbursable if necessary, outside warranty, and up to replacement cost. Replacements are covered for medical necessity, growth/weight changes, damage, wear (after 5-year minimum useful life), or loss due to theft/fire/disaster (with police report required for theft). The policy explicitly excludes enhancements for convenience or aesthetics, experimental devices, over-the-counter orthotics, and repairs during warranty or due to abuse/neglect. Dental prosthetics are handled via separate dental vendor agreements.

**Key Points**

- ✅ Reimbursement is allowed for prosthetic/orthotic devices when medically necessary and ordered by a qualified provider; bundled services (fitting, training, etc.) are not billed separately.
- ✅ Repairs and replacements are covered for medical necessity, damage, wear (after 5 years), or loss (with police report for theft); warranty-covered repairs are excluded.
- ❌ Non-reimbursable: aesthetic upgrades, convenience enhancements, experimental devices, OTC orthotics, abuse/neglect-related repairs, or warranty-period repairs.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP policy (G-06112), effective April 6, 2023, governs reimbursement for repair or replacement of durable medical equipment (DME), supplies, prosthetics, and orthotics during the manufacturer’s warranty period under New York Medicaid. Anthem does not reimburse providers for such services unless mandated by state, federal, or CMS contracts. The manufacturer or distributor is responsible for repairs, replacements, and associated shipping costs. If Anthem has already reimbursed a provider for warranty-covered services, it may recoup those funds from the manufacturer. Reimbursement for replacement through a different manufacturer is considered only if both the member and provider find the original manufacturer’s replacement unacceptable — and even then, only if the replacement is medically appropriate and not separately billable. If a reduced-price replacement is offered by the manufacturer, Anthem will reimburse only up to that reduced cost unless a higher-cost item is approved.

**Key Points**  
- **No Reimbursement During Warranty**: Anthem will not reimburse for repair or replacement of DME, supplies, prosthetics, or orthotics during the manufacturer’s warranty period unless required by law or contract.  
- **Manufacturer Responsibility**: The manufacturer/distributor must cover repair, replacement, and all associated shipping costs during the warranty period.  
- **Recoupment & Exceptions**: Anthem may recoup payments made in error; reimbursement for alternate manufacturer replacements is allowed only if the original is deemed unacceptable by both member and provider — and only for the cost of the replacement item, not additional services.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-10033, effective 12/14/2023) outlines guidelines for billing and reimbursement of reduced or discontinued services using CPT/HCPCS modifiers 52, 53, 73, and 74. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and facilities, provided services are medically necessary, properly authorized, and billed with compliant codes supported by medical documentation. Reimbursement is generally reduced to 50% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate for modifiers 52, 53, and 73, while modifier 74 is reimbursed at 100%. Anthem reserves the right to audit claims with these modifiers and may recoup payments if guidelines are not followed. The policy may be superseded by state, federal, or CMS mandates.

**Key Points**

- **Modifiers 52, 53, 73**: Reimbursed at 50% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate; used for reduced services, discontinued procedures, or outpatient cancellations prior to anesthesia.
- **Modifier 74**: Reimbursed at 100% of the applicable fee schedule or contracted rate; used when a procedure is discontinued after anesthesia administration due to extenuating circumstances.
- **Billing Requirements**: Claims must use industry-standard codes (CPT/HCPCS/revenue codes) fully supported by medical records; failure to comply may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield policy (NY_ABC_CAID_RP_RoboticAssistedSurgery.pdf, effective November 2023) addresses reimbursement for technology-assisted surgical procedures, including robotic and computer-assisted systems. Anthem does not provide separate or additional reimbursement for these technologies unless mandated by provider contracts, state/federal law, or CMS requirements. These procedures are considered integral to the primary surgical service and are bundled into the payment for the primary procedure. The policy explicitly lists CPT codes S2900, 0054T, and 0055T as non-reimbursable when billed separately. The policy was renamed and expanded in 2023 to include computer-assisted surgical systems beyond just robotic-assisted surgery.

**Key Points**  
- **No Separate Reimbursement**: Technology-assisted surgical procedures (robotic or computer-assisted) are not reimbursed separately; they are bundled into the primary procedure payment.  
- **Non-Reimbursable Codes**: CPT codes S2900, 0054T, and 0055T are explicitly listed as non-reimbursable when billed in addition to the primary procedure.  
- **Policy Supersession**: Reimbursement may be overridden by state, federal, or CMS contracts or mandates; Anthem reserves the right to recoup payments if policies are not followed.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) policy outlines reimbursement guidelines for surgical services when care is split among multiple providers using CPT modifiers 54 (surgical care only), 55 (postoperative care only), and 56 (preoperative care only). The policy emphasizes that total reimbursement for a global surgical package — which includes preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative services — must not exceed the amount paid if a single provider performed all components. Each provider must bill the same CPT code with the appropriate modifier to reflect their portion of care. Claims submitted with split-care modifiers after a global claim has already been paid will be denied. Reimbursement is based on a percentage of the fee schedule or contracted rate, determined by the modifier used. The policy also notes that assistant surgeon and multiple procedure rules apply when relevant, and that billing must comply with industry standards and medical necessity requirements.

**Key Points**

- **Modifier Use Required**: Providers must use modifiers 54, 55, or 56 to indicate which component of the global surgical package they performed; all providers must bill the same CPT code with the appropriate modifier.
- **Reimbursement Caps**: Total reimbursement across all providers for a single global surgical package cannot exceed the amount paid if one provider performed all services.
- **Claim Denial Rule**: Claims with split-care modifiers submitted after a global surgical claim has been paid will be denied; proper sequencing and timing of claims are critical.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) reimbursement policy (G-06163) outlines coverage criteria for sterilization procedures. The policy permits reimbursement for sterilization intended to render a member permanently incapable of reproduction, provided all state and federal requirements are met. Reimbursement is contingent upon submission of a properly executed, state-approved consent form and adherence to specific timing, competency, and procedural guidelines. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes accurate coding and documentation to avoid claim denial or recoupment.

**Key Points**  
- **Consent Requirements**: Informed consent must be obtained at least 30 days (but no more than 180 days) prior to the procedure; 72 hours prior in cases of emergency or premature delivery. Consent is invalid if obtained during labor, under influence of substances, or during abortion-seeking.  
- **Eligibility Criteria**: Member must be at least 21 years old, legally and mentally competent, and not institutionalized at the time of consent.  
- **Documentation & Billing**: A valid consent form with all required signatures (member, interpreter if needed, consent obtainer, and performing physician) must accompany claims. Failure to submit a valid form may result in claim denial. Multiple surgery guidelines apply if performed with delivery.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-06004) governs the use and reimbursement of unlisted or miscellaneous codes. It applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes that such codes should only be used when no established CPT, HCPCS, or revenue code adequately describes the service, procedure, or item rendered. Reimbursement is determined on a case-by-case basis and requires supporting documentation — including written descriptions, operative reports, invoices, or NDC codes — to substantiate the claim. The policy also notes that reimbursement is contingent upon meeting medical necessity, authorization, and billing compliance standards, and that failure to follow guidelines may result in claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment. The policy is subject to state, federal, or CMS mandates and may be updated as needed.

**Key Points**

- **Use Only When Necessary**: Unlisted or miscellaneous codes must be used only when no specific CPT or HCPCS code exists to describe the service or item.
- **Documentation Required**: Claims must include detailed documentation (e.g., operative reports, invoices, NDC codes) to support reimbursement.
- **Reimbursement Not Guaranteed**: Even if a code is accepted, reimbursement depends on medical necessity, authorization, and compliance with billing rules — and may be adjusted or denied if guidelines are not followed.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-05022, effective 11/04/2024) outlines coverage and billing guidelines for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. It applies to eligible members aged 18 and younger who receive vaccines through the VFC Program. Anthem reimburses providers only for the administration fee of VFC-provided vaccines — not the vaccine serum, which is supplied free of charge. Providers must include both serum and administration codes on claims to meet regulatory and HEDIS® reporting requirements. Reimbursement follows CDC-set maximum fee limits and is based on Anthem’s fee schedule or contracted rates. Office visits are separately reimbursable unless the vaccine administration is the sole service rendered — in which case, no minimal office visit fee is allowed. During state VFC supply shortages, Anthem may reimburse for vaccine serum as well.

**Key Points**  
- **Coverage**: Reimbursement is limited to vaccine administration fees for VFC-eligible children; vaccine serum is not reimbursed unless during a documented state supply shortage.  
- **Billing Requirements**: Claims must include both serum and administration codes with appropriate modifiers; failure to do so may result in claim denial or rejection.  
- **Office Visits**: Separate reimbursement for office visits is allowed only if additional services are performed; no reimbursement for minimal office visits when vaccine administration is the only service.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**

This Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of New York (NY) Medicaid reimbursement policy (G-13001) governs inpatient readmissions and aims to prevent duplicate reimbursement for unplanned readmissions occurring within 14 days of discharge for the same or closely related condition. The policy applies to facilities reimbursed under Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) methodology. It outlines clinical and coding criteria to determine whether a readmission is considered part of the original admission or a separate, billable event. The policy also includes specific exclusions (e.g., neonatal, obstetrical, trauma, cancer, sickle cell, and planned readmissions) and clarifies that same-day readmissions are treated as continuations of the initial admission. Anthem reserves the right to deny claims or recoup payments for non-compliant submissions.

**Key Points**

- **No Separate Reimbursement for Unplanned Readmissions**: Claims for unplanned readmissions within 14 days for the same or related condition are not reimbursed separately unless mandated by contract or regulation.
- **Clinical Review Criteria**: Readmissions may be evaluated for complications, failed interventions, preventable care gaps, or premature discharge using clinical coding or medical review.
- **Exclusions Apply**: Readmissions for neonatal, obstetrical, trauma, burns, cancer, sickle cell, SNF/LTAC, planned readmissions, or against medical advice are excluded from this policy and may be reimbursed separately.

**LLM Response:** "**Policy Summary**  
This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield New York Medicaid policy (G-01017) outlines reimbursement rules for preadmission services rendered prior to an inpatient hospital stay. The policy aligns with CMS guidance and defines a “payment window” during which certain diagnostic and admission-related outpatient services are bundled into the inpatient reimbursement and thus not separately payable. The window varies by facility type: 3 days (including admission day) for general acute care hospitals, and 1 day for specialized facilities such as psychiatric, rehabilitation, long-term care, children’s, and cancer hospitals. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) are exempt from these windows and may bill preadmission services separately. Services outside the window — such as ambulance, dialysis, or those provided by SNFs, home health, or hospice — may be eligible for separate outpatient reimbursement. Providers must use correct CPT/HCPCS/revenue codes and may use Condition Code 51 to bill unrelated nondiagnostic services separately.

**Key Points**  
- **Payment Window Rules**:  
  - 3-day window (including admission day) for general hospitals; 1-day window for specialized facilities.  
  - CAHs are exempt — preadmission services are separately reimbursable.  
  - RHC/FQHC services are excluded from the window and billed under their all-inclusive rate.  
- **Non-Reimbursable Within Window**: Diagnostic and admission-related outpatient services are bundled into inpatient payment.  
- **Separate Reimbursement Eligible**: Services outside the window (e.g., ambulance, dialysis, SNF, home health, hospice) or unrelated nondiagnostic services (with Condition Code 51).

This Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield HP (New York Medicaid) policy, titled “Provider Preventable Conditions” (Policy #G-20003, effective 03/22/2023), outlines reimbursement guidelines for hospital-acquired and provider-preventable conditions (PPCs). The policy states that Anthem will not reimburse for PPCs — including Health Care-Acquired Conditions (HCACs) and other provider-preventable conditions — unless mandated otherwise by state, federal, or CMS contracts. HCACs are identified via Present on Admission (POA) indicators submitted with inpatient claims. If a condition is flagged as HCAC (POA = “N”), associated charges and days are excluded from DRG reimbursement calculations, potentially lowering payment. The policy applies to both participating and non-participating providers and emphasizes strict adherence to coding and billing guidelines to avoid claim denial, recoupment, or adjustment.

**Key Points**

- **Non-Reimbursement for PPCs**: Anthem does not reimburse for Provider Preventable Conditions unless required by law or contract; HCACs are specifically excluded from DRG payment calculations if identified via POA indicator “N”.
- **POA Indicator Requirement**: All inpatient primary and secondary diagnoses must include a POA indicator (Y/N/U/W/1); failure to submit may result in claim denial or rejection.
- **Exempt Facilities**: Certain facilities (e.g., psychiatric hospitals, CAHs, LTACs, children’s hospitals) are exempt from POA reporting requirements under Medicare methodology, which also applies to Medicaid in this context.
